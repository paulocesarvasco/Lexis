# Program developed for the LexisNexis selection process

## Usage
    - The program consists of reading a .txt file containing an m x n matrix containing only 0 and 1 without spaces. (where: m*n <= 1000)
    - The file path must be passed as argument in the program call.
    - The program will print on stdout a matrix of the same size as the input but with zero in every row and column that the original matrix has a zero in one position.
